# A Front-End Website for a business product idea: Prod-Tech

This website was created using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Animation**, some **JavaScript** for basic functionalities and **Heroku** for web hosting. It is my first completed website; it helped me gain a good understanding of the fundamental knowledge of web programming.

I built this website for my Honors Management Info System course back in 2017. The website acts as a presentation. It includes Productivity Tech (Pro-Tech) App's features, instructions, as well as SWOT and financial analysis.

Here is the link to the website: https://productivity-tech.herokuapp.com/
